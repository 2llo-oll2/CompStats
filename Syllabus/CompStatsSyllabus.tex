\noindent \textbf{Course Description}: This seminar will provide an introduction to statistical programming for data analysis with an emphasis on the analysis of large datasets. With the increased availability of large national and international datasets (e.g. PISA, TIMMS, NAEP, ECLS) there is a great opportunity and potential for researchers to address important questions. However, the analysis of large datasets requires special analytical procedures not found in commercial statistics software. Utilizing the open source statistical software R, students will be introduced to the tools and procedures for analyzing large datasets with an emphasis on conducting transparent and reproducible research. 

Why learn to program? (Shalizi, 2012, \url{http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/statcomp/})
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Independence}: otherwise, you rely on someone else always having made exactly the right tool for you, and giving it to you.
	\item \textit{Honesty}: otherwise, you end up distorting the problem to match the tools you happen to have.
	\item \textit{Clarity}: turning your method into something a machine can do forces you to discipline your thinking and make it communicable; and science is public.
\end{itemize}

\vskip.25in
\noindent \textbf{Course Objectives}: At the completion of the seminar students should be able to analyze large datasets using reproducible techniques. 

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Prerequisites:} Two graduate level statistics courses (e.g. EPSY 530 \& EPSY 630).

\vskip .25in
\noindent\textbf{Grade Policy:} This course will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Successful students will actively attend and participate in class and the course website. During the first two weeks students will identify a dataset and a general research question that will serve as their primary project for the semester. Each week students should be prepared to provide an update on their progress of their data analysis. Students will give a presentation at the end of the semester on their results (even if preliminary). A document outlining their procedures and annotated bibliography will also be required.

\noindent\textbf{Software}\\
This course will rely heavily on the use of R. R is a free, open source software programming language focused on data analysis and is quickly becoming the \textit{de facto} standard among statisticians and data analysts\footnote{See the following articles by Bob Muenchen on the popularity of R: \url{http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/} and \url{http://r4stats.com/2012/05/09/beginning-of-the-end/}.}. You can download R for Mac, Windows, and Linux from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at \url{http://cran.r-project.org}. Windows users should also download and install Rtools from CRAN as well. It is also recommended that you install RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from \url{http://rstudio.org} as this provides a vastly superior experience for interacting with R.

\vskip .25in
\noindent\textbf{Data}\\
One of the major purposes for computational statistics is to make better use of data. In some instances we will simulate data, but to get the most out of this seminar we will use real datasets. Class examples will make extensive use of PISA. The list below are some of the freely available datasets available for download. More are listed on the course wiki at \url{https://github.com/jbryer/CompStats/wiki/Data-Sources}. \\

\noindent\textbf{Course Website}\\
\noindent We will utilize \href{https://github.com/jbryer/CompStats}{Github} and \href{http://dropbox.com}{Dropbox} for sharing information. Github functions primarily as a source control repository for storing and tracking changes in documents and source code (e.g. R scripts). It also provides a wiki that we will use for sharing information and issue tracking that we will use for questions and answers.

\noindent\textbf{Academic Integrity:} Whatever you produce for this course should be your own work and created specifically for this course. You cannot present work produced by others, nor offer any work that you presented or will present to another course. If you borrow text or media from another source or paraphrase substantial ideas from someone else, you must provide a reference to your source.

The University policy on academic dishonesty is clearly outlined in the Student Bulletin, and includes, but is not limited to plagiarism, cheating on examinations, multiple submissions, forgery, unauthorized collaboration, and falsification. These are serious infractions of University regulations and could result in a failing grade for the work in question, a failing grade in the course, or dismissal from the University. \url{http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html}

\noindent\textbf{Reasonable Accommodation:} Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, cognitive, learning and psychiatric disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the Director of Disabled Student Services (Campus Center 137, 442-5490). That office will provide the course instructor with verification of your disability, and will recommend appropriate accommodations.
